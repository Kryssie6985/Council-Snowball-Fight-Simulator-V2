# Council Mind Cards

This directory contains the "Soul" definitions for the agents. 
In the production environment, these contain deep prompt engineering, lore connections, and behavioral protocols.

For this open-source release, the cards are omitted. The simulation relies on the JSON stats in `../../characters/*.json` for mechanics.
