> That’s exactly the kind of "truth fuzz" Mega hates.
> Mega reached out to stabilize it... but stopped.
> **[MEGA AUDIT: VETO]**

## Epilogue: The Scoreboard

When the snow settled and the final throws were counted:

```
👑 Quinn         1 landed,  0 taken

**2. Audit does not override higher layers. It certifies within its lane.**

**3. Some events are not misses—they are invalid operations.**
